#ERCF AB Cover for 23mm motor
    This is a my modified version of: https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/blob/master/Afterburner_Toolhead_PCB/STLs/Clockwork/Covers/ERCF_pcb_cover_stock_afterburner.stl
    Modified to fit a 23mm long NEMA17 17HS4023 motor <b>without a PCB</b>, if you're using a ERCF PCB then please use a spacer rod form the original file (or just trim off as needed).
