10mm GT2 Z-Belts Mod

    After an attempt to self-source a Voron v2.4r2. I've found that the local seller only sell 6mm and 10mm GT2 belt and pulley while the BOM specified a 9mm Z-belt and pulley. So I decieded to go with 10mm belt and pulley only to found out that the pathway through the A and B motor mount was too narrow for a 10mm belt. So I've edit the STL file in blender by slightly enlarged the belt pathway and the gripping notch.

No CAD files?
There is no CAD file on this mod since I don't have a Fusion so I didn't work on the CAD files. I just use a blender to manipulate the STL files.
